# PlainAPI

This is a tool that lets you create APIs using English language.
It uses GPT3 to translate between user defined queries and SQL statements.

Note: You will need to be in the OpenAI API Beta program in order to use this.
If you are not in the program and would still like to use this,
sign up at [plainapi.co](https://plainapi.co).


## Installation

You should have Python 3.6+ to run this.

Run
`pip install git+https://github.com/jmerizia/plainapi.git#egg=plainapi`
in your terminal to get started.

## Generate an API

Run `plain init` in your terminal
to get started with a new project in the local directory.
This will create some initial boilerplate.
